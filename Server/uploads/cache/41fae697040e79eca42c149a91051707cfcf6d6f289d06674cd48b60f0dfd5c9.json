"Artificial Intelligence\nTE AI&DS\nSemester V\nExperiment 08\nAim: Write Simple Programs Using PROLOG as an AI Programming\nLanguage\nTheory:\nPROLOG (Programming in Logic) is a declarative programming language primarily\nused for solving problems that involve relationships and logical reasoning. In\nPROLOG, a program consists of facts, rules, and queries.\n\u2022\nFacts: Statements that represent knowledge about the problem domain.\n\u2022\nRules: Logical constructs that define relationships between facts.\n\u2022\nQueries: Questions asked to the system to retrieve knowledge or infer new\nfacts based on existing ones.\nPROLOG is widely used in artificial intelligence applications such as natural\nlanguage processing, knowledge representation, and automated reasoning,\nwhere logic and rules are critical.\nName: Hringkesh Singh\nBatch: T2-2\nRoll Number: 2201104\nArtificial Intelligence\nTE AI&DS\nSemester V\nCode:\n1. Program -\n% Facts\nparent(john, mary).\nparent(mary, alice).\nparent(mary, bob).\n% Rule: X is a grandparent of Z if X is the parent of Y and Y is the parent of Z\ngrandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).\n% Query\n?- grandparent(john, alice).\n2. Program -\n% Fact: X is a member of a list if X is the head of the list\nmember(X, [X|_]).\n% Rule: X is a member of a list if X is a member of the tail\nmember(X, [_|T]) :- member(X, T).\n% Query\n?- member(3, [1, 2, 3, 4]).\n3. Program -\n% Rule: X is greater than Y\ngreater(X, Y) :- X > Y.\n% Rule: The maximum of X and Y is X if X > Y\nmax(X, Y, X) :- X > Y.\n% Rule: The maximum of X and Y is Y if Y >= X\nmax(X, Y, Y) :- Y >= X.\n% Query\n?- max(5, 10, M).\nOutput:\nName: Hringkesh Singh\nBatch: T2-2\nRoll Number: 2201104\nArtificial Intelligence\nTE AI&DS\nSemester V\nCode 1:\nCode 2:\nCode 3:\nName: Hringkesh Singh\nBatch: T2-2\nRoll Number: 2201104\nArtificial Intelligence\nTE AI&DS\nSemester V\nConclusion:\nIn this experiment, we successfully implemented and ran simple\nPROLOG programs to solve logic-based problems.\nLO2 mapped.\nName: Hringkesh Singh\nBatch: T2-2\nRoll Number: 2201104\n"
